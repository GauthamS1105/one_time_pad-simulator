One-Time Pad Encryption Simulator:
This is a simple Python program that shows how the One-Time Pad (OTP) works.
You type a message, the program creates a random key, encrypts the message, and then decrypts it to show the result.

How It Works:
1.You enter a plaintext message.
2. The program generates a random key of the same length.
3.It encrypts the message using XOR.
4.It shows:
   Plaintext
   Key (in hex)
   Ciphertext (in hex)
5.It decrypts the ciphertext back to the original message.
